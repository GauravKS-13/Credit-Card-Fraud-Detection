Credit Card Fraud Detection

Implemented the Random Forest algorithm to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. A dataset of over 280,000 transactions was used for this project. The class imbalance was compensated for by under-sampling the data. The evaluation metric used was the F1 Score, with it being 0.96.
